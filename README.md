My and one of my cohortmates, Aret Tinoco, had grouped up to finish an assignment for our cohort summer program. We set our sets on creating an interactive alarm that took some brain power to turn off correctly, prompting the user of the product to wake up a tad bit more than what a usual alarm would provide. 

The project was seperated into multiple functions in order to better work on things. These functions were the Alarm clock, flappy bird game, images, background, and highscore. Although some functions are a part of another, this separation helped us work on the project more efficiently 
Our process was separated into 4 javascript files although it could be done on one. We have the alarm, bird, pipe, and script. The script is where it all comes together, it brings the pipe and bird to form the game. The alarm precedes that and serves as the purpose until the given time is reached which then activates the game. The goal is to reach a given high score and afterwards, a snooze popup is shown which signifies the end of the game and alarm.
